## By Priyanshu Dubey(Student no - 2374690)

### How to run the code:

The provided code is a jupyter notebook file with the extension `.ipynb`. To run this notebook import it to either jupyter notebook or to google colab. You can also import it to VS Code but it will require some additional setup to use this notebook in VS Code.

Follow below steps to visualize the same bar plot using the provided ipynb file:-

- Run the first code cell which has required liabraries mentioned for the use.
- Run the next code cell for loading the dataset which is in excel format to the code using `pandas.read_excel` function.
- Then the 3rd code cell is optional to run, it is printing shape of dataset and data type of the dataset.
- After that run the 4th code cell where we are selecting the `player_positions` column for the visualization.
- Then comes the final cell where we are plotting the bar graph using `sns.barplot` function.

## Used liabraries for this code:

| Liabrary   | Used as                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pandas     | import pandas as pd             |
| Numpy      | import numpy as np              |
| Matplotlib | import matplotlib.pyplot as plt |
| Seaborn    | import seaborn as sns           |
